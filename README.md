# Coca-Cola-IOS-Prototype
UI/UX Coca-Cola Prototype for IOS Application

# The Concept
For Coca-Cola’s UI app concept, I decided to implement a theme of nostalgia.

Coca-Cola’s marketing and branding is that Coca-Cola brings people together and creates memories. This branding strategy is reinforced through strong imagery of friendships, family, and using warm, film-like colors.

# The Home Page
I brainstormed several home page ideas that would set the tone for the rest of the UI design. I sketched wire frames to draft where things would go and how it would look.

After sketching the wire frames, I realized that my favorite idea (a vending machine as the home page with animated cans) would likely be too busy.

I quickly found an image of a Coca-Cola vending machine, put it on Adobe XD, and confirmed I didn’t like the idea in practice and scrapped it.

My next idea was a minimalistic design; I wanted to keep the home page simple with a large image and a top menu and bottom menu. The concept looked nice in practice but I didn’t find it memorable or unique.

I came up with the collage idea (the final concept) on a whim and implemented a high fidelity prototype without drafting it. My original idea of one main image stayed and I simply added a collage of images below it to act as the home page categories.

I thought about masking the category images into polaroids to emphasize a nostalgic feeling, but found that polaroids made it look busier than I liked. Instead, I labeled the sections with masking tape and “Permanent Marker” font, which emphasized the warm nostalgic feel while creating separation and legibility.

The bottom navigation bar was also scrapped to simplify navigation, declutter the pages, and create a straight-forward user experience.

To tie in the warm images and scrapbook-like aesthetic, I used off-white, light brown, red, dark gray, and black as theme colors.

# The Sidebar Navigation
When the hamburger menu is selected, the hamburger lines extends and turns red to indicate it’s selected, and the side menu opens.

The final sidebar navigation hasn’t changed much from the original wire-sketch. It’s a dark gray sidebar that overlays and collapses back. I added icons for each menu category, social media navigation, and quick access to log in/sign up.

I also changed the navigation arrows to plus signs for the expanders; the right-pointed arrows seemed more indicative of an item that opens a new page rather than expanded the menu down because they pointed outside of the menu. The plus sign better-shows that the selection will expand when selected.

When expanding a selection, the relevant icon turns red and the plus signs turns into a minus sign. These animations/states show what categories are currently selected/expanded.

For the subcategories, the right-pointing arrow rotates down and turns red, and the subcategory title turns red to indicate that it’s currently selected.

# Product Page: Grab a Coke
I went for a slightly monochromatic color scheme for the “Grab a Coke” product page. I used different darkness levels of the off-white theme color to separate the different elements and selections.

There is a large search bar that is used to search and filter through the current app page/category. So, the large search bar will only search within the “Grab a Coke” products.

The search bar next to the cart is meant to act as a general search for the overall app.

# Filter Menu
Next to the search bar is a filter button/menu. The filter menu applies to the current category, so in this case the filter button will open the “Grab a Coke” filter menu.

When filters are selected, the selection circle turns red to indicate the user’s selection(s).

The plus button(s) open the selection pop-up where you can choose the product packing and quantity.

There is an upwards-pointing arrow that indicates it’s a drop-down menu.

The “Add to Cart” button turns red and the Coke bottle rotates/flicks to give feedback and indicate the product was added to the cart. The “Add to Cart” button also transforms to “Added to Cart” to provide additional feedback/confirmation, and a red Coke bottle appears in the shopping cart in the top right corner.

I provided multiple, detailed, visual effects to show the user that their product is in their cart.

# About Us
For the “About Us” page, I wanted it simple with clear separation between the sections. The “Learn More” button would lead to a dedicated app page or webpage to the relevant topic.
